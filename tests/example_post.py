# Python (programming language) - source:
# `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)`.
#
# Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy
# emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
#
# Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming
# paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and
# functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due
# to it's comprehensive standard library.

# Built-in types:
truth = True  # Use `True` or `False`
hello_world = bytearray(b"hello, world")  # Mutable sequence of bytes
hello_there = bytes(b"hello there!")  # Immutable sequence of bytes
north_west = 2 + 2j  # Complex numbers
# etc

# Python supports gradual typing. Python's syntax allows specifying static types, but
# they are not checked in the default implementation CPython. An experimental optional
# static type-checker, mypy, supports compile-time type checking.

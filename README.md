An auto-formatter for pretty and readable comment formatting in python.

WARNING: `comform` is made for my own usage so it's not been tested in a variety of
environments. Use it on your own code at peril `;)`.

Comments are formatted as markdown text using the fantastic
[`mdformat`](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat) package. Treating comments as
markdown has drawbacks, but I've found these to be outweighed.

## Usage

This package can be installed from PyPI as usual via `pip install comform` and is meant
to be used as a command line tool. It can also be used as a `pre-commit` hook, but only
with a local copy installed (known issue, see
[here](https://github.com/j-hil/comform/issues/2)). Whichever way `comform` is used I
recommend running `black` first; it was developed for this use-case.

The command line interface is:

```ps1
comform [-h] [--version] [--check] [--align] [--dividers] [--wrap N] paths [paths ...]
```

and inputs can also be configured in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.comform]
# these are the default values:
check = false
align = false
dividers = false
wrap = 88
```

`check`, `align` and `dividers` work if they are set in the CLI **or** the config. If
`wrap` is set in both then the CLI takes priority.

## Development
